Follow Prerequisites
1. is needed (in VisualStudioCode Search for "Python" in Extensions (on left hand side))
2. is probably not needed (Python is usually included in the OS), probably check
3. is needed, if you work with Windows

Create a project environment for the Flak tutorial
1. is not needed, the "hello_flask" folder is "LS-IFL"
2. do this however you like (either with "code ." or via GUI) - on the left hand side in the Explorer you should see "applets", ".flaskenv" and so on
3. follow the description as well as the options in VS Code - the virtual environment should appear in the explorer when created
3.1 one can setup the virtual environment via the terminal (there might be problems on Windows), so the easiest way is to follow the suggestions of the VisualStudio GUI:
- Strg+Shift+P > Python: Create Environment
- Select an environment type > Venv
- Select a Python installation > local path to python installation (if you have a microsoft store version, this did not work for me)
- Select dependencies to install > requirements.txt (very important, otherwise one cannot work!)
- wait till finished :)

The rest is not needed (if you followed the steps above)

The local server can be started from the Terminal via "flask run" and Strg+left mouse on "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
